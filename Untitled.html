A recent Microsoft study shows that hybrid work works.1 The biggest risk of a hybrid workforce is not unproductive team members—it's that people are becoming burnt out from too many meetings and a lack of clear, defined priorities.<br>But it takes intention and leadership to design a company culture where collaboration workflows let everyone contribute equally in retrospectives, standups, planning, and other agile projects where bold ideas and clear alignment are critical to staying competitive in the market. Now, more than ever, agile teams, or any team focused on planning and strategizing are expected seamlessly connect and collaborate regardless of where everyone is working.<br>Microsoft, in partnership with Mural’s leading collaborative intelligence system, is filling a critical need. Powered by Microsoft Azure and integrated with Microsoft Teams, Mural enables dynamic meetings and teamwork turning ideas and insights into reality so remote work no longer inhibits co-creation. Mural's latest integration with the Microsoft ecosystem connects Azure DevOps to an intuitive workspace for teams to collaborate visually. Mural centers around a digital whiteboard and includes pre-built frameworks that guide and structure collaborative work, including templates for agile ceremonies and LUMA design thinking practices. Facilitation tools built into the product, like voting and a timer, make it intuitive for teams to work together intentionally and make it easier for everyone to contribute. Mural’s new integration with Azure DevOps is the connective tissue for agile teams, no matter where they’re working.<br>Level up your team’s next collaboration session with Mural and Azure DevOps<br>With Mural’s new integration, Mural and Azure DevOps customers can now save time and jumpstart collaboration by easily importing work items as sticky notes onto a Mural canvas.

Having work items on the canvas where collaboration is happening keeps workflows connected and teams focused without incurring a toggle tax by switching between applications.2<br>93 percent of surveyed organizations who leverage agile experienced an increase in collaboration and productivity following the implementation of Mural.3<br>Everything from user story mapping to retrospectives are more productive, inclusive, and engaging when you connect Mural and Azure DevOps.<br>How Mural and Azure DevOps work<br>Connect Azure DevOps to your Mural account to view your projects and easily import work items as sticky notes.
